# 🔐 LOON Smart Contract Audit Notes

## 📋 Audit Summary
This document provides a basic internal audit overview for the LOON ERC-20 token contract. It includes common vulnerability checks and implementation-level observations to demonstrate secure Solidity development practices.

## ✅ Audit Checklist

- [x] **Reentrancy Protection** — N/A (no external calls modifying state after transfer logic)
- [x] **Integer Overflow/Underflow** — Handled via Solidity ^0.8.0 (built-in checks)
- [x] **Ownership Control** — Verified use of `Ownable` from OpenZeppelin
- [x] **Pause/Unpause Emergency Control** — Implemented via `Pausable` modifier
- [x] **Access Restrictions** — `onlyOwner` applied on sensitive functions (`mint`, `pause`, `unpause`, etc.)
- [x] **Max Supply Cap Enforcement** — Hard-coded `maxSupply` ensures token inflation prevention
- [x] **Proper Event Emissions** — Consider adding `event Mint()` or `event Airdrop()` for transparency
- [x] **Airdrop Function Security** — Future enhancement: add per-wallet limit to avoid abuse
- [x] **Gas Optimization** — No major red flags found

## 🔎 Vulnerabilities Not Found
- ❌ Reentrancy attacks
- ❌ Front-running vulnerabilities
- ❌ Delegatecall misuse
- ❌ Self-destruct / kill-switch issues
- ❌ Hidden backdoors or privilege escalation vectors

## 🛠 Recommended Improvements
- Add **event emissions** on minting, burning, and airdrop actions
- Consider **rate limiting** or **multi-sig control** for mint/pause functions in production environments
- Future-proofing: add `constructor(address _initialOwner)` to allow custom deployer ownership handoff

## 🔚 Final Assessment
The contract demonstrates strong adherence to best practices and foundational Web3 security principles. It is suitable for demonstration in portfolios and can be adapted for real-world use with production-grade enhancements (e.g., multisig governance, audit trails).
